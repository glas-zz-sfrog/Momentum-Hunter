# Momentum Hunter Roadmap

## Authority

This is the single authoritative view of current product position, active work, and next work. Update its `Now` section from Git evidence before a task is reported complete, merged, or blocked.

Supporting records have narrower roles:

- `BRANCH_LEDGER.md` is the detailed Git and branch-evidence record.
- `TASK_LOG.md` and `CHANGELOG_ARGUS.md` are append-only history.
- Historical architecture notes and release reports remain evidence of their original decisions; they do not override this Roadmap.

## Now

Last reconciled: 2026-07-19 after Phase 10 follow-up verification on `codex/ARGUS-R010-tradeplan-risk-simulation-integration` at `893a6da`; local `master` remains ahead of `origin/master` and has not been pushed.

| Item | Current truth |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical product baseline | Local `master` contains `802dea7 Record Phase 8 and 9 integration` and is seven commits ahead of `origin/master` at `30c0e0b`. The local merge is approved; no `master` push has occurred. |
| Active product decision | The Windows-first WPF workstation is the accepted operator-surface direction, while Python remains the canonical trading and evidence engine. |
| Integrated implementation | Phase 8 and Phase 9 are `COMPLETE` on local `master` through `802dea7`. Phase 10 is `IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_MERGE` on its task branch through `893a6da`: the Python host supplies every valid persisted TradePlan, Risk Governor, FakeBroker-only simulation, ledger, and audit evidence to WPF; charts remain deferred. |
| R004 status | `COMPLETE`: workstation-shell feasibility is integrated into `origin/master`. |
| R005 status | `COMPLETE`: close-to-tray, lifecycle controls, single-instance activation, and physical Windows tray QA are integrated into `origin/master`. |
| Immediate next action | Steven restarts Momentum Hunter after gaming and manually reviews Phase 10 on `codex/ARGUS-R010-tradeplan-risk-simulation-integration`: a selected persisted candidate must show its TradePlan and Risk Governor state; a missing plan must state `Plan unavailable` and keep simulation disabled. After explicit approval, Git Steward may fast-forward the branch into local `master`. |
| Remote backup action | Do not push local `master` without Steven's separate explicit approval. The merged feature branches remain backed up on `origin`. |
| Broker and execution state | No paper or live broker path, credentials, API keys, or real order path exists. Paper and live remain locked. |

### Status Legend

- `NOT_STARTED`: no implementation has begun.
- `ACTIVE`: work is underway on the named branch.
- `IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_MERGE`: work is committed and verified on a branch, but Steven has not approved its local merge.
- `COMPLETE`: work is merged into local `master` and verified.
- `BLOCKED`: a stated gate or CEO decision prevents work from starting.
- `DEFERRED`: valid future work, intentionally not the current priority.

### Roadmap Governance

Status: `COMPLETE`

- The authoritative Roadmap is integrated into `master`; `CURRENT_STATE.md` remains deleted.
- This file is the single live state view; branch history and canonical paths are recorded in their supporting governance files.

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 - Office Scaffold

Status: `COMPLETE`

- Establish agent roles, operating rules, templates, branch policy, and protected-area rules.
- Keep governance separate from product runtime behavior.

### Phase 1 - Read-Only Mapping

Status: `COMPLETE`

- Map critical routes, data flows, scoring surfaces, replay surfaces, alerts, storage, and operator workflows.
- Use maps and audits to identify small, protected implementation slices.

### Phase 2 - Scoped Improvements

Status: `COMPLETE`

- Turn approved findings into bounded Builder tasks with focused tests and protected-path review.
- Preserve scoring, readiness, replay, storage, and execution behavior unless a separate task explicitly approves a change.

### Phase 3 - Release Discipline

Status: `COMPLETE`

- Maintain task, branch, decision, quality, and release evidence.
- Require Steven approval for local merge and explicit approval for push.

### Phase 4 - Automation And Simulation Foundation

Status: `COMPLETE` on `origin/master`

- Use neutral product terminology: Automation, Simulation, Machine Room, Risk Governor, Execution Ledger, Trade Plan, and operator review.
- Keep `Argus` as the Codex builder and office persona, not a product-screen or product-flow name.
- Retain the existing Python simulation foundation: TradePlan, Risk Governor, FakeBroker-only simulation, Execution Ledger, and Execution Auditor.
- Keep every paper and live execution boundary locked.

### Phase 5 - C# WPF Operator-Surface Feasibility

Status: `COMPLETE / DIRECTION ACCEPTED`

- Preserve Python as the canonical engine for research, scoring, readiness, replay, storage, trade planning, risk, and simulation.
- R004 proved the Windows-first WPF workstation shell: docked and floating panes, linked contexts, persistent layouts, recovery behavior, and simulation-only safety language.
- R005 proved close-to-tray behavior, single-instance activation, lifecycle controls, restricted tray commands, and physical Windows tray behavior.
- WPF is the accepted planned operator surface, subject to continued phase-gated validation; it is not a Python-engine rewrite or broker integration.
- Keep Hide, Pause Monitoring, and Exit as separate lifecycle operations. Tray or layout state must never store execution authorization, credentials, API keys, broker permissions, or order-routing permissions.

### Phase 6 - Python Simulation Foundation And Evidence Research

Status: `COMPLETE` on `origin/master`

- `momentum_hunter/autonomy/*`, `trade_planning.py`, and the current Python UI modules remain the canonical implementation on `master`.
- The clean-room simulation foundation and hardening tests are merged on `master`.
- Technical Breakout Research Engine v1 and its daily OHLC source are merged on `master`; they remain research-only and do not alter production scoring or execution behavior.
- The older standalone execution-model branch and earlier simulation branch are superseded; see `BRANCH_LEDGER.md`.

### Phase 7 - WPF Workstation And Background Lifecycle

Status: `COMPLETE`

- R004 and R005 are integrated into `origin/master` at `e14105493061ec133ecd273aaac21d8e33ead5cf`.
- R004 supplied the workstation shell: docked, tabbed, floating, resizable panes; linked chart contexts; saved layouts; SQLite recovery; and simulation-only safety language.
- R005 supplied close-to-tray behavior, explicit exit, session-ending behavior, single-instance signaling, restricted tray commands, and the in-process background-collection lifecycle. Physical Windows QA passed.
- Collection continues while the WPF application process is alive and the visible workstation is hidden.
- The Python engine is not independently hosted yet. A WPF process crash or explicit process exit still stops the current R005-hosted lifecycle.

### Phase 8 - Headless Python Engine Through Versioned Contracts

Status: `COMPLETE` on local `master` through `a886c90`; not pushed to `origin/master`

- The approved Goal Charter creates versioned, provider-neutral host identity, health, collection, capability, command, and structured-error contracts.
- `momentum_hunter/engine_host.py` owns the independent loopback-only Python Engine Host. WPF discovers an existing host or launches one, reconnects by host identity, and deliberately shuts it down only on explicit Exit.
- The host has an atomic single-host lease, per-command idempotency, non-overlapping cycle guard, and a guard against the existing active-monitor runner starting a second collection loop.
- The host core owns snapshot, pause, resume, one collection cycle, and graceful shutdown. Phase 9 adds one versioned persisted-evidence snapshot capability; TradePlan, Risk Governor, chart data, simulation, broker, Paper, and Live remain outside the boundary.
- Focused Python process proof and .NET integration proof passed. The remote feature branch remains preserved; the implementation fast-forwarded into local `master`. See `reports/releases/ARGUS-R008-python-engine-contract-host.md`.

### Phase 9 - Read-Only Discovery, Research, Health, And Replay Integration

Status: `COMPLETE` on local `master` through `a886c90`; not pushed to `origin/master`

- Connect WPF panes to the Phase 8 read-only boundary for candidates, evidence, research context, health, and replay.
- Preserve source lineage, stale-data language, and read-only replay identity.
- Use the independent engine lifecycle rather than a workstation-owned collection loop.
- The first slice exposes persisted report/status snapshots only and explicitly disables mock TradePlan, chart, risk, and simulation fallback until Phase 10.
- Focused Python tests, focused C# presentation/integration tests, a C#-to-Python host proof, broader nearby Python regression, the full .NET suite, and full Python discovery passed before the Steven-approved local fast-forward.

### Phase 10 - Trade Planning, Risk, And Simulation Integration

Status: `IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_MERGE` on `codex/ARGUS-R010-tradeplan-risk-simulation-integration`

- The versioned Python host exposes a persisted-plan simulation workspace snapshot and a symbol-scoped FakeBroker-only simulation command.
- WPF consumes the canonical persisted TradePlan, Risk Governor, Execution Ledger, and Execution Auditor evidence rather than a mock fallback; charts intentionally remain deferred with no synthetic candles.
- A Risk Governor block prevents the simulation call and states that no evidence changed. A permitted simulation records risk, preview, FakeBroker outcome, and audit evidence in the in-memory host ledger.
- Follow-up commits `14fe317` and `893a6da` remove the Top-5-only plan mapping mismatch and the empty Risk Governor badge: all valid persisted candidate plans are exposed, and a missing plan explicitly shows `Plan unavailable` with simulation unavailable rather than a blank colored state.
- Focused Python simulation/host/autonomy tests, focused WPF presentation tests, the full .NET workstation solution, and release compilation passed. Manual visual proof of the follow-up build remains pending a clean workstation restart. Full Python discovery was bounded at 120 seconds and did not complete; retain that test-harness timeout as a follow-up risk.

### Phase 11 - Broker Research And Hardening Before Paper Execution

Status: `DEFERRED`

- A016 broker research remains valid but is not the immediate Builder priority.
- Begin broker research only after the WPF direction and Python engine boundary are proven enough to define a stable integration surface.
- No credentials, API keys, paper adapter, order routing, or paper execution code belongs in this phase without a separate Goal Charter.

### Phase 12 - Incremental Capability Migration And Qt Retirement

Status: `NOT_STARTED`

- Migrate individual proven workflows to the WPF shell only after their Python contracts and operator proof are complete.
- Retire corresponding Qt screens incrementally, with acceptance evidence and rollback paths. Do not perform a broad rewrite.

### Phase 13 - Paper Execution Gate

Status: `BLOCKED`

- Requires completed Phases 8-12, a Steven-approved paper-execution Goal Charter, broker research, adapter safeguards, audit evidence, and explicit paper-only UI and mode boundaries.

### Phase 14 - Live Execution Gate

Status: `BLOCKED`

- Requires successful paper-operation evidence, a separate CEO decision, explicit credential and approval controls, independent audit review, and a dedicated live-execution Goal Charter.

## Roadmap Update Protocol

At every substantive task closeout, the responsible agent must:

1. Reconcile the `Now` section against `git status --short --branch`, the active branch HEAD, and local `master` versus `origin/master`.
2. Move the affected roadmap phase to the correct status without calling branch-only work `COMPLETE`.
3. Record the concrete next action and any new block or decision gate.
4. Update `BRANCH_LEDGER.md` only when branch/merge/push state changes, and `TASK_LOG.md` or `CHANGELOG_ARGUS.md` as historical evidence requires.
5. Cite the resulting Roadmap transition in the final CEO report.

## Protected Areas

Do not change core scoring logic, trade readiness logic, replay identity rules, historical capture selection, database schema/migrations, broker/order execution behavior, alert threshold semantics, secrets/API keys/env config, production configs, or runtime behavior without explicit approval.
